In Python, the data type is set when you assign a value to a variable:
x = "Hello World" => data type is string
x = 20 => data type is int
x = 20.5 => data type is float
x = 1j => data type is complex
x = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] => data type is list
x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry") => data type is tuple
x = range(6) => data type is range
x = {"name" : "John", "age" : 36} => data type is dict
x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"} => data type is set
x = frozenset({"apple", "banana", "cherry"}) => data type is frozenset
x = True => data type is bool
x = b"Hello" => data type is bytes
x = bytearray(5) => data type is bytearray
x = memoryview(bytes(5)) => data type is memoryview
x = None => data type is Nonetype
